# Baby Name Trends

This repo contains some exploratory data analysis of baby name trends from the [Popular Baby Name](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/index.html) dataset, from the US Social Security Administration (SSA). This notebook expects that you've already downloaded the national data product and uncompressed it into a directory called `names` that contains all of the year of birth (yob) `.txt` files in the current working directory.
